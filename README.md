cython-simple-wrapper
=====================

This is an extremely simplified example of how-to-create a Cython wrapper for your C modules, in order to use them easily with python. Here I have a fibonacci function written in calcul.c, and I want to compile it (=> .so), write the cython wrapper, create a python module (=> .so too), import it and use it.

See http://ascii.io/a/1434 . (a little buggy)
